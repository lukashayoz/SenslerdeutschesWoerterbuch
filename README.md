# Introduction

This project aims to parse the Senslerdeutsches Wörterbuch, generate JSON data, and make it searchable using Elasticsearch. The frontend is built with Angular, and the backend uses Elasticsearch running in Docker containers.

# Getting Started

1. Installation process

   - Copy and rename the `.env.defaults` file into a `.env` file and add the missing variables as described in the file 
   - Use Docker Compose to at least run elastic and the proxy:

     ```sh
     docker compose up -d elasticsearch proxy
     ```

   - Create a Python virtual environment and activate it:
     ```sh
     python -m venv venv
     # Windows
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     # macOS/Linux
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - Install the required Python packages:
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Populate elastic search with data using the python script
     ```sh
     python parsing/pdf_parser.py
     ```
   - Generate an API key

     ```curl
     curl -X POST "http://localhost:4202/elastic/_security/api_key" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -u elastic:${ELASTIC_PASSWORD} \
     -k \
     -d '{
     "name": "angular_app_key",
     "role_descriptors": {
      "app_role": {
        "cluster": ["monitor"],
        "indices": [
          {
            "names": ["*"],
            "privileges": ["all"]
          }
        ]
      }
     }
     }'
     ```

   - Paste the "encoded" version of the API key in the `apiKey` variable of `search.service.ts`.
   - Start the Angular app in the container (or use ng serve)
      ```sh
        docker compose up -d frontend
      ```

2. Software dependencies

   - Python 3.x
   - Docker and Docker Compose
   - Elasticsearch and Kibana
   - Angular CLI

3. Latest releases
   - Todo
4. API references
   - Todo

# Build and Test
Angular unit tests can be run normally. Just make sure you have Chrome available.
```
cd senselerdeutsches-woerterbuch
ng test
```

E2e tests are using Playwright.
```
cd e2e
npm install
npx playwright test
```

GitHub Actions are used to run the tests automatically. To test and debug them locally we suggest using https://github.com/nektos/act. After downloading the binary you can use it with a simple command.
```
bin/act --seceret-file .env
```

# Architecture

A first version uses an angular frontend directly connected to an Elasticsearch docker container

A second iteration migt introduce a lightweight backend inbetween to prevent exposing Elasticsearch to the public. Elasticsearch has documentation about how to setup this direct connection, but they also recomend at some places to use a lightweight backend to prevent the exposure of Elasticsearch to the public.

A separate database is ommited. Elasticsearch is optimized for **speed** rather than **resilience**. Typically, a second database is used as the **source of truth**, with Elasticsearch serving as a **fast, searchable replica**.
However, given the **low frequency of updates**, maintaining synchronization between a traditional **source-of-truth database** and Elasticsearch can be **omitted** to simplify the setup.

# **Tasks**

## 1. Parsing Dictionary Documents to Generate JSON

- **V1:** Keyword + Text
- **V1.1:** Keyword + Text while **preserving formatting** (e.g., italics, special characters)
- **V2:** Keyword + Additional structured fields in the description

## 2. Setup of a Simplified Dockerized Development Environment

- **Frontend:** Angular
- **Backend:** Elasticsearch as **BaaS**

- Reference: [Elasticsearch Search Applications](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-application-overview.html)

  --> This task is parially done, in the current state. There is an angular application with a client which is able to call the an Elasticsearch instance running in a docker container. However, the apikey is not generated in the setup and thus every developer to generate its own key in his docker container

## 3. Frontend Development

- **Search Page / Landing Page**
- **Search Results Page**
- **Details Page**

## 4. Setup & Experimentation with Elasticsearch

- **Import JSON data** into the Elasticsearch database
- **Enhance search similarity** by generating new fields:
  - Normalize words
  - Generate **Soundex** codes for phonetic similarity
    - Reference: [Soundex for German](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex#Soundex_f%C3%BCr_die_deutsche_Sprache)
  - Other possible improvements...
- **Optimize search suggestions** while typing by experimenting with different Elasticsearch query techniques
